File Manager:
	green icon for added and not saved
	red icon for dirty
	Add New, delete selected, open selected
	can filter by saved/unsaved
	Make names only save with save button

Bugs:
Can't change texture map in voxel meta
Can't add stats onto voxel meta
Polygon model editing is bugged
Normals don't work - cannot open them
Stat textures file opening
Voxel Meta doesn't open right file - Select
GUI Lines - not working on blueprints
Skeletons doesn't load other skeletons

Things to add:
Resizeable windows
maximize for all guis
Generate guis - or use custom data:
	Use generator for Lore Element
Gui Editor
a toolbar with minimized guis
a minimize function and animation for windows

Things to do:
Push textures into a Element - store either blueprints or texture
	-Same with audioclip
Push skeletons into a skeletonData element class - instead of a string - skeletons will use this data
